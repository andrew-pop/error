this code gives me the 'Error: Aesthetics must be either length 1 or the same as the data (1): fill' when i use fill in geom_bar


data<-data.frame(team='Detroit Tigers',
                   pitchers_taken=33,
           color='#0c2c56')


ggplot(data=data, aes(x=team, y=pitchers_taken))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = color)

this code gives me the error listed above and i would like the bar chart to be filled with the 
actual color of #0c2c56 which is supposed to be a navy blue
